# Contributing

I'm listing good sources I've come across. But there may be unknown treasures. Please feel free to forward it to me.

## Guideline

* Create a PR for a link in the format of `Add project-name`. Explain why this resource is awesome.
* Add the link in the format of `* [project-name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period.`
    * Keep descriptions concise and **short**.
    * If the source name and the website name are not same, add name. Otherwise, skip it. Examples:
      * `[Frontend Masters: Frontend Developer Roadmap](https://frontendmasters.com/guides/learning-roadmap/)`
      * `[Web Skills](https://andreasbm.github.io/web-skills/?compact)`

* Add a section if needed.
    * Add the section description.
    * Add the section title to Table of Contents.
* Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
